    <h1>Styles of Learning</h1>
    <p>Muller and Dweck both present theories on how people learn best. While discussing different aspects of learning, both
    of their theories could be considered optimistic in that they imply anyone can learn if they do it right. Dweck claims that there are
    mindsets that people have on intelligence and that one's mindset has a drastic effect on their learning success; she portrays a
    dichotomy between the "fixed mindset" and the "growth mindset." Muller, in his theory, claims that in order for someone to learn
    something they must be met halfway in thier ignorance as oppposed to being dictated the facts. This mirrors the idea of the Socratic
    method which will also be discussed.</p>
    <p>In her lecture, Dweck discusses the two mindsets people have when it comes to learning; these being the "growth mindset" and the 
    "fixed mindset." Those in a "fixed mindset" beleive that intelligence is a fixed trait whereas those in a "growth mindset" believe that
    intelligence is something that can be developed through hard work. She states that those who believe intelligence is something that
    can be earned typically do better academically than those in the fixed mindset. Dweck also cites research that backs up her claim;
    one study concluding that pre-med students that placed a great importance on learning/improving instead of just getting good grades
    typically got better grades over students who just focused on grades.</p>
    <p>Muller implies in the video that people don't learn anything from merely repeating a fact and for some reason just hearing info 
    without really learning it makes them more ignorant (he doesn't metion why). Blind memorization is what most schools test for and 
    consequently how many students get by. However, as mentioned earlier in the study Dweck referenced, students who only mermorize info
    instead of learning and understanding the underlying concepts do worse. Perhaps we learn better when we organize info and place it 
    into our worldview as oppsoed to holding onto it and letting it go as soon as we don't immediately need it. Muller's interviews with
    people on the street resemble the Socratic method of asking questions repeatedly as a means of seeing what a person really knows and 
    forcing them to think about what they claim to know. The old Greek dude Socrates, the guy who is attributed to this rhetorical method,
    is accounted by other old greek dudes like Plato and Xenophon as making people look like fools as a side effect of forcing them to 
    acknowledge their ignorance; Muller's method is pretty much the same except with a video camera.</p>
