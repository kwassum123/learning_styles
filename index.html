    <h1>Styles of Learning</h1>
    <p>Muller and Dweck both present theories on how people learn best. While discussing different aspects of learning, both
    of their theories could be considered optimistic in that they imply anyone can learn if they do it right. Dweck claims that there are
    mindsets that people have on intelligence and that one's mindset has a drastic effect on their learning success; she portrays a
    dichotomy between the "fixed mindset" and the "growth mindset." Muller, in his theory, claims that in order for someone to learn
    something they must be met halfway in thier ignorance as oppposed to being dictated the facts. This mirrors the idea of the Socratic
    method which will also be discussed.</p>
    <p>In her lecture, Dweck discusses the two mindsets people have when it comes to learning; these being the "growth mindset" and the 
    "fixed mindset." Those in a "fixed mindset" beleive that intelligence is a fixed trait whereas those in a "growth mindset" believe that
    intelligence is something that can be developed through hard work.
